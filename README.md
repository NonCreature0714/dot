# D.O.T. - DevOps Tool
# One tool to rule them all, one tool to find them,
# One tool to bring them all and in the darkness bind them ...

## What is D.O.T.? 

D.O.T. (or dot) is my response to the bredth of tools out there for DevOps, configuration management, security, and troubleshooting. It is an abstraction on top of many other tools, and intelligently incorporates necessary packages by "unlocking" them when they are called. This means D.O.T. starts "locked," and must be unlocked... like a dungeon! 

# How is this code organized?

This is organized like so: 

 - main.py : program entry point
 - dev/ : dev directory, for dev related tools, services, etc.
 - ops/ : ops directory, for ops related tools, services, etc. 
 - devops/ : a directory for things which don't quite fit cleanly into dev or ops, like configuration management.

## So, what are "dev" things?
